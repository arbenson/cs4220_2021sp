# HW5 data



This is a choice dataset based on online hotel bookings. The items are hotels, and the choice sets are hotels that were displayed to a user when they made a search query on an online hotel booking web site. The selection made from the choice set is the hotel that was booked by the user.

Each line of the hotel-choice.txt represents a choice set, where the first number is the item that was selected. 

The file hotel-metadata.txt has some extra information on the hotels. Each line is the hotel id number, the star rating of the hotel, and the average user review score of the hotel.
